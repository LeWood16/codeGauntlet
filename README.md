# Code Gauntlet

Code Gauntlet is a collection of JavaScript exercises, designed to be done in quick succession to develop your "coding muscle memory."

The current version of this project is simply a list of exercises in a markdown file (it's just a baby :D), but future versions will include:

* An actual website (hosted on Github Pages) to run the project
* An embedded IDE (probably JSBin) to test your work on the exercises
* A timer to track your progress, possibly even a persistent system to track both our own past progress and your progress as compared to others
* A system of tests to track how performant your code is
* A searchable database with hundreds of exercises, tagged to be searched for difficulty, area to work on, your success rate from past sessions, etc
* The database will allow you to structure a personalized gauntlet (e.g. should you only want to work on closures or generators, you could select those on a list, and a gauntlet of 50-100 exercises would be dynamically generated for you
* A leaderboard to track the top users (fastest gauntlets, most performant code, top contributors of exercises, etc.)
* and likely much, much more!
