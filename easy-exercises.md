A collection of easy JavaScript exercises; sort of a "warm-up" module to stretch your coding muscles a bit. Set a timer, open up your favorite REPL, and see how far down the list you get before the timer goes off.

1. Write a function that reverses a number.

2. Write a function that alphabetizes all characters of a given string.

3. Write a function that checks whether or not a given string is a palindrome (i.e. a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, like 'mom, dad, peep', etc).

4. Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter, and then converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case.

5. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string.

6. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string, skipping the letter 'y,'

7. Write a JavaScript function which accepts an argument and returns the type.

8.  Write a JavaScript function that accepts a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.

9. Write a JavaScript function which will take an array of numbers stored and find the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively.

10. Write a JavaScript function to convert an amount to coins. (e.g., amount is 89, coin values are [50, 25, 10, 5, 1], output is [50, 25, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1]).
