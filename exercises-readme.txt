My skills as a JavaScript developer are still very mediore.  This blog is my project on going pro.


This project essentially kills three birds with one stone.
-It lets me hone my skills at developing a professional-grade project, in the way a professional developer would (via git/version control)
-It lets me get up to scratch on working with git and pushing/maintaining a code project
-I get to work on my "code gauntlet" idea, which borrows concepts from Kathy Sierra's talk on "Making Badass Developers," or reaching proficiency at something in a very short space of time.
-I get to hone my fundamental technical skills as a JavaScript developer, by building exercises and tutorials that coalesce with Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" series (which I skimmed through a first reading of, but can now get acquainted with on an intimate level).
