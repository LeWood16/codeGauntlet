My skills as a JavaScript developer are still very mediore.  This blog is my project on going pro.


This project essentially kills three birds with one stone.


1. It lets me hone my skills at developing a professional-grade project, in the way a professional developer would (via git/version control).


2. I get to work on my "code gauntlet" idea, which borrows concepts from Kathy Sierra's talk on "Making Badass Developers," or reaching proficiency at something in a very short space of time.

3. I get to hone my fundamental technical skills as a JavaScript developer, by building exercises and tutorials that coalesce with Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" series (which I skimmed through a first reading of, but can now get acquainted with on an intimate level).

To save time, I'll be both making my own exercises AND finding exercises and tutorials from several different sources (with proper citations as needed).  This is designed to saturate the learner with countless differenct examples of a code tool or concept, focusing on working as hard as possible in a short period (2-3 hours).

Other tutorials gloss over (or at the very least allow the learner to gloss over) a concept with 2 or 3 examples, and the learner is responsible for pursuing any further learning they need if they feel they don't quite grasp the concept.

Frankly, a few examples is not enough to grasp the concept of a new programming tool, let alone be confident and comfortable enough with using it in your code (or knowing the best place in your code to use it!) For me, saturating myself with a new tool by using it in a sort of "code gauntlet" is the answer. Without using the new tool so much that it becomes a part of your coding routine, you run the risk of reverting back to concepts that are simpler and more comfortable to you (in the case of a new developer, using for-loops where you arguably shoudn't, or chaining if-else loops together in a chaotic speghettified mess when something more dynamic and scalable arguably should be used instead.
